The state of this branch is work in progress, as the transition to jogl2 and the new graphstore
is not yet completed.

The following issues are still open (not yet tracked via github, as 0.9 is not yet released publicly):
* A number of TODOs in various source files:
  * e.g.: TODOs to support editing of DynamicAttributes DataLaboratory & ToolsPlugin
* Rectangle selection seems not to work any more
* a couple of plugins are not yet migrated (and commented in modules/application/pom.xml)
* Writing a migration hint, since many third party plugins will break with the transition to gephi 0.9
* DataLaboratory DuplicateColumn seems not to recognize column name duplications (there seems to be a case issue for column ids managed by the store)
* 

Questions:
* HierarchicalGraph was removed. So, grouping of nodes is no longer a supported featue? => adapt ClusteringController to reflect the changes
